Kel this weather app is a solid build that successfully moves from design to a working product. You correctly prioritized the 5-day forecast to meet assignment rules, showing great attention to requirements.

Looks Good:
The Vibe: The "glass" cards and nature background create a high-end, professional look.
Smart Code: Using a separate file for favorites keeps the logic clean and organized.
Functionality: The app successfully pulls live data and saves recent searches.

Final Tweaks:
Readability: Darken the cards slightly so the white text pops against the clouds.
The "Stretch": Add a max-width to the container to stop side-to-side scrolling on big screens.
Asset Links: Fix the broken image names in the assets folder so all icons appear.
Search Bar: Slim down the padding to match the sleekness of the original mockup.

this looks great! its pretty accurate to the figma apart from a couple small suggestions like maybe having the star further, golden and bigger like the prototype. i really like the blur effect you have on the cards. i feel like it makes the text a lot easier to read. great job!
